# blood pressure monitor

Track your blood pressure wherever you go. offline, ad-free and open.
This application allows you to easily store your records and export all your records to a csv file. 

## Getting Started

To use this app, download the version for your platform from the release page.

While building an ios app would be no problem code wise, but apples restrictive behavior makes this more complicated (and expensive). 

## todo:

- [ ] add to f-droid
- [ ] add to play store (not coming soon)
- [ ] import from csv
- [ ] edit/delete entries in app
- [ ] ensure that no data loss can occur during version changes
